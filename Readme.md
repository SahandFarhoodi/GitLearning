### Git_test_project
This file is supposed to explain what is going on in this repository. For now I have the following files here:
* Readme.txt: A file full of not meaningful comments! These are the comments that came to my mind when I was creating and committing new files!
* Friends.txt: A list of friends. This one was used to navigate through old versions of it and practice stuff like show, modify, amend, log, ...
* .gitignore: This is a list of files that I want Git to ignore, as they are sensitive!
